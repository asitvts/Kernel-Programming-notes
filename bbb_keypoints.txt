BeagleBoard is an open-source single-board computer (SBC) developed by the BeagleBoard.org Foundation, designed primarily for developers, 
engineers, and researchers who want to explore embedded Linux, hardware interfacing, and low-level system programming

designed for industrial-grade and low-level embedded development, not just for learning or basic projects.

Programmable Real-Time Units (PRUs)

The AM335x SoC in BeagleBone Black includes two 32-bit microcontrollers called PRU-ICSS (Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem).

These are independent cores that can run real-time tasks (like toggling GPIO pins with nanosecond precision) outside the main Linux OS.

You can use them for:

Precise motor control

Industrial communication (Modbus, Profibus, etc.)

Generating PWM signals

Capturing sensor data in real time

This is something Raspberry Pi cannot do directly, because it doesn’t have such independent real-time cores.

Because of the PRUs and direct memory access to I/O pins, latency is extremely low and deterministic

You can build and flash your own kernel and root filesystem

Bootloader (u-boot), Linux kernel patches, and Debian-based OS images are open-source

Onboard eMMC flash storage** (faster than SD card)

 Developing a custom Linux driver** for a peripheral
 
 Learning bootloader and kernel compilation
 
 
 
You can:

Change how GPIOs behave (e.g., through device tree or drivers),

Write your own drivers for custom peripherals,

Change scheduler behavior or real-time settings,

Optimize PRU communication.

So yes — you’re changing the SBC’s behavior, because the SBC = hardware + software + OS stack.

But…

🧱 4. You cannot alter the SoC itself

The SoC (AM335x) is physically manufactured silicon —
you can’t “change” its structure, logic gates, or internal cores through software.

You cannot:

Modify its instruction set (ARM Cortex-A8),

Add more PRUs or GPIO pins,

Rewire its buses or internal cache architecture,

Change its fabrication technology.

These are all fixed at the time of chip manufacturing by TI.
