Great — this is an important topic because **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)** pins are the heart of the BeagleBone Black (BBB).
Let’s break down **all the key GPIOs**, what makes them important, and which ones are commonly used.

---

## 🧠 **What Are GPIO Pins?**

* GPIO pins are **programmable pins** that can act as either **input** or **output**.
* They let the BBB **interface with external hardware** — like LEDs, buttons, sensors, motors, etc.
* The BeagleBone Black has **65 GPIO pins** in total (though not all are available at once because some are shared with other onboard functions).

---

## 🧩 **BeagleBone Black Pin Headers Overview**

The BBB has **two 46-pin headers**:

* **P8 Header (left side)**
* **P9 Header (right side)**

Each header = 46 pins (total 92 pins), but not all are GPIO — many are power, ground, or special function pins.

---

## ⚙️ **GPIO Pin Numbering System**

Each GPIO pin corresponds to a **bank** and a **bit**:


Linux GPIO number = (32 × X) + Y
X = Bank number, Y = Bit number



## 🧠 What is a **Bank Number**?

A **GPIO bank** is like a **group** or **block** of GPIO pins managed together by the processor (the AM335x SoC on the BeagleBone Black).

Each **bank** contains **32 GPIO pins**, and the processor (AM335x) controls them through internal registers.
This organization helps the processor efficiently read/write multiple pins at once.

---

### ⚙️ The BeagleBone Black Has 4 GPIO Banks:

| **Bank**   | **GPIO Names**     | **Linux GPIO Range** | **Description**              |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Bank 0** | GPIO0_0 → GPIO0_31 | 0–31                 | System and low-number pins   |
| **Bank 1** | GPIO1_0 → GPIO1_31 | 32–63                | Most commonly used GPIOs     |
| **Bank 2** | GPIO2_0 → GPIO2_31 | 64–95                | Also used for expansion pins |
| **Bank 3** | GPIO3_0 → GPIO3_31 | 96–127               | Fewer exposed pins on BBB    |

Each GPIO pin’s full name is written as:


GPIO<bank_number>_<pin_number_within_bank>
```

Example:

* `GPIO1_28` means **Bank 1**, **pin 28 inside that bank**
* Linux treats it as a single number:
  **(32 × Bank) + Pin → (32 × 1) + 28 = GPIO60**

---

## 🧩 Why Banks Exist

The **AM335x SoC** groups GPIOs in banks because:

* Each bank has its **own control registers** (for input/output, pull-up/down, interrupts, etc.)
* It allows **faster access** (the CPU can modify 32 pins in one operation)
* It keeps the hardware logic organized internally

---

## 🧮 Example: Calculating Linux GPIO Numbers

Let’s see a few examples:

| **Pin Name** | **Bank** | **Bit #** | **Linux GPIO No. (32×Bank + Bit)** | **Header Pin** |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| GPIO0_30     | 0        | 30        | 30                                 | P9_11          |
| GPIO1_28     | 1        | 28        | 60                                 | P9_12          |
| GPIO2_3      | 2        | 3         | 67                                 | P8_8           |
| GPIO3_21     | 3        | 21        | 117                                | P9_25          |

So if you see documentation saying **“GPIO1_28”**, you know:

* Bank = 1
* Offset = 28
* Linux number = 60

and you’d control it like this in Linux:

```bash
echo 60 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio60/direction
```

---

## 🔍 Quick Visual Analogy

Think of it like a building:

* Each **bank** = a floor in the building
* Each **GPIO** = a room number on that floor
* The **Linux GPIO number** = “flat number” formed by combining floor × 32 + room

Example:

```
Bank 1, Pin 28 = Flat 60  (since 32×1 + 28 = 60)
```

## 💡 Summary

| **Concept**                   | **Meaning**                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Bank**                      | A group of 32 GPIOs controlled together |
| **Bank count**                | 4 banks (GPIO0–GPIO3)                   |
| **Purpose**                   | Organizes and speeds up GPIO access     |
| **Linux GPIO number formula** | (32 × Bank Number) + Pin Number         |
| **Example**                   | GPIO2_3 → (32×2) + 3 = GPIO67           |

| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |

## 🧰 **Special Function Pins (Important)**

Some GPIO pins can also perform **other alternate functions** when configured:

| **Function** | **Pins**                                   | **Use**                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **PWM**      | P8_13, P8_19, P9_14, P9_16                 | Motor / LED control                                 |
| **UART**     | P9_11, P9_13 (UART4), P9_24, P9_26 (UART1) | Serial communication                                |

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes / Precautions**

* **Voltage limit:** All GPIOs are **3.3V only** — applying 5V will permanently damage the board.
* **Boot pins:** Some GPIOs double as **boot mode pins** (used during power-on). Avoid using those for your circuits unless you know what you’re doing.
* **Power draw:** Each GPIO can safely source/sink about **6–8 mA** only. Use a transistor or MOSFET for driving high-current devices like motors or relays.
* **PWM pins** are ideal for dimming LEDs or controlling servos.

## 💡 **Example (Blink LED on P9_12)**

```bash
# Export GPIO60 (P9_12)
echo 60 > /sys/class/gpio/export

# Set direction to output
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio60/direction

# Turn LED ON
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio60/value

# Turn LED OFF
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio60/value
```

When you hear **AM335x** in the context of the **BeagleBone Black (BBB)**, that’s referring to the **main processor chip** — the *brain* of the entire board.

---

## 🧠 **What is AM335x?**

The **AM335x** is a **family of ARM-based System-on-Chip (SoC)** processors designed by **Texas Instruments (TI)**.
The “x” in AM335x means there are several variants (like AM3352, AM3358, AM3359, etc.) — each one with slightly different features (like GPU support, PRU units, or Ethernet count).

👉 The BeagleBone Black uses the **TI AM3358** version.

---

## ⚙️ **What Is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?**

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** means **multiple components of a computer are integrated into one single chip**, such as:

* CPU (Central Processing Unit)
* GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
* Memory controller
* USB, Ethernet, SPI, I²C, UART controllers
* PWM and ADC modules
* Timers and Interrupt controllers
* PRUs (Programmable Real-Time Units — special for BeagleBone!)

So, instead of using separate chips for each feature, the AM335x packs them all together efficiently.
